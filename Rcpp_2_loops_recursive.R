# Vector as the function argument and single value (scalar) as a result

# The big difference between R and C++ is that there is time overhead
# of a loop in R is very large, and in C++ much smaller

# lets write the function that calculates the average 
# of the numeric vector (equivalent to the built-in
# mean() function - VERY fast and efficient)

myMeanR = function(x) {
  sum = 0
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n)
    sum = sum + x[i]
  sum/n
}

# C++ equivalent

# The function version in C++ is similar to R, but:
# - in C++ we find the length of the vector using the .size() method
# - the for() loop has a different syntax in C++:
#   for(init; check; increment).
#    - in C++, INDEXING VECTORS STARTS FROM 0!
#    - the loop is initiated by creating an index variable
#      init (in our case: i) with the value 0
#    - before each iteration we check if i<n, and finish the loop,
#      if condition is NOT met.
#    - after each iteration the value of i is increased by 1 using
#      special increment operator i++, which increases the value by 1.
# - i++ is the operator that modifies the value of i "in place":
# - other in place modifying operators: -=, *= and /=
# - for the assignment operation in C++ we use 
#   the equality sign = , not <-
